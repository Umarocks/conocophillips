#taking in a csv file, a specific category of data, and country...
#generate a portable graph featuring a previous set of years, then
#create a linear regression using the data to predict future trends
#if the regressive line passes a given threshold within a range, not sustainable
#if the regressive line passes the threshold at a mid-way point, somewhat sustainable
#if passes very far away, then sustainable, and if basically never, very sustainable
