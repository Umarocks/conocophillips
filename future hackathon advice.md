Conclusion: Back-end worked, front-end needed refinement, which may involve back-end optimizations. 
|Present Issue|Future Solution|
|--------------|-----------------------|
|Issues with Front-to-Back Integration|Should use a pre-existing library, package, or code and connect data-sets and APIs to that|
|Multithreading Issues|Double check APIs and libraries are compatible with multithreading.|
|Optimization in General|Use reliable software and packages to avoid variable runtimes and unreliable executions. Aditionally, avoid processing large amounts of data|
|Avoid Race Conditions|Have a resilient plan and schedule. Also, don't worry about it, it's a competition, not a fight|
