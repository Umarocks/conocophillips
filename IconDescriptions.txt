In 2022, ConocoPhillips Joined the Oil Sands Pathways to Net-Zero alliance, which includes Canadian Natural Resources, Cenovus Energy, Imperial, MEG Energy and Suncor Energy. Together this group represents the companies operating approximately 95% of Canada’s oil sands production. The goal of the alliance is to achieve net-zero GHG emissions from oil sands operations by 2050 to help Canada meet its climate goals, including the country’s Paris Agreement commitments and 2050 net-zero aspirations.
We are a member of the Coalition for Safer Alberta Roads, a collaborative initiative aimed at improving driving behaviors for the communities near our oil sands operations.
We develop formal agreements with Indigenous Peoples (who consist of First Nations, Metis and Inuit) near our operations that focus on shared value and address specific promises, obligations and benefits for all parties.
The Sustainable Communities Initiative creates shared benefit and value in Indigenous communities.
We were awarded for our long-standing support of Indigenous women in Canada by Women Building Futures, an organization that empowers economic prosperity for women by removing barriers and providing industry recognized training in the construction trades, maintenance, transportation industries and more.

We initiated a project in 2021 to utilize lower-carbon alternative fuel sources in the Permian. Rather than relying solely on diesel fuel to power fracking operations, the project aims to use compressed natural gas and liquefied natural gas to electrically power hydraulic fracturing (e-frac) fleets.
We began a solar plant study that aims to determine the feasibility of installing a photovoltaic solar plant to power operations and sell surplus energy to the current electricity provider. The study will also evaluate technical conditions for connection of the solar plant to the existing power grid.
We are conducting a study that aims to better understand the long-term load demand for the Permian basin as well as upgrades that may be required if the basin was to fully electrify. As part of this project, we have engaged with several key Permian operators representing about 60% of Permian Basin production to collaborate on these infrastructure and electrification solutions.
